## Features

### 1. Utility Functions for DataFrames
- **Common Transformations:** Easily perform common DataFrame transformations like column renaming, null handling, type casting, and duplicate removal.
- **Aggregation Helpers:** Simplify aggregations by calculating sums, averages, and counts for multiple columns with a single function call.
- **Schema Validation:** Validate schemas against predefined standards to ensure data consistency.

### 2. Performance Optimization Tools
- **Caching and Persisting:** Intelligently cache and persist DataFrames based on usage patterns to improve performance.
- **Partition Management:** Suggest optimal partitioning strategies to avoid data skew and enhance performance.
- **Join Optimization:** Automatically broadcast small DataFrames and provide suggestions for efficient join types.

### 3. Data Quality and Validation Checks
- **Data Profiling:** Automatically profile datasets to gain insights into distributions, outliers, and missing values.
- **Automated Data Validation:** Define rules and automatically validate your data against them.
- **Alerting System:** Trigger alerts when data quality issues are detected.

### 4. Logging and Monitoring
- **Execution Logging:** Detailed logging of Spark job execution, including stages, tasks, and metrics like memory usage, to aid in debugging and performance tuning.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Integrate with monitoring tools to provide real-time insights into Spark job health.
- **Error Handling Utilities:** Standardized error handling patterns with descriptive error messages and retry mechanisms.

### 5. Easy Integration with Other Tools
- **Connector Abstractions:** Easy-to-use connectors for popular data sources and sinks (e.g., Hive, HDFS, S3, RDBMS, NoSQL databases).
- **Integration with ML Libraries:** Wrappers and utilities to integrate Spark with popular ML libraries like MLlib, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
- **Data Export Tools:** Simplified exporting of DataFrames to formats like CSV, Parquet, Avro, or directly to visualization tools.

### 6. Testing and Debugging Tools
- **Unit Testing Support:** Simplified unit testing of Spark code, including mock DataFrames and validation of transformations.
- **Debugging Helpers:** Tools to inspect RDD lineage, track down issues in distributed computations, or visualize data flow.

### 7. Enhanced SQL Support
- **SQL Query Builder:** Programmatically build complex SQL queries with safety and readability in mind.
- **SQL Optimization Suggestions:** Analyze SQL queries and receive optimization suggestions.
- **Schema Inference Tools:** Advanced schema inference utilities for handling nested structures, array types, and complex JSON formats.

### 8. Data Sampling and Exploration
- **Sampling Techniques:** Generate representative samples from large datasets for exploration or testing.
- **Data Exploration Tools:** Summarize data, generate descriptive statistics, and visualize distributions directly from DataFrames.

### 9. Documentation and Examples
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear and thorough documentation with examples and use cases to help you get started.
- **Example Notebooks:** Jupyter/Zeppelin notebooks showcasing common use cases and best practices.

### 10. Customization and Extensibility
